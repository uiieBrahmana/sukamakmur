.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
gammu\-smsd reads configuration from a config file. It\(aqs location can be
specified on command line, otherwise default path \fB/etc/gammu\-smsdrc\fP
is used.
.sp
This file use ini file syntax, see \fIini\fP.
.sp
Configuration file of gammu\-smsd consists of at least two sections \-
\fB[gammu]\fP and \fI\%[smsd]\fP. For \fIgammu\-smsd\-sql\fP
you can also use \fI\%[sql]\fP.
.sp
The \fB[gammu]\fP section is configuration of a phone connection
and is same as described in \fIgammurc\fP with the only exception that
\fI\%LogFile\fP is ignored and common logging for gammu library and
SMS daemon is used. However the \fBLogFormat\fP directive still
configures how much messages gammu emits.
.INDENT 0.0

.B [smsd]
The \fI\%[smsd]\fP section configures SMS daemon itself, which are described in
following subsections. First general parameters of SMS daemon are listed and
then specific parameters for storage backends.

.B LoopSleep
The number of seconds how long will SMSD sleep before checking for some
activity. Please note that setting this to higher value than 1 will have
effects to other time based configurations, because they will be effectively
rounded to multiply of this value.
.sp
Setting this to 0 disables sleeping. Please not this might cause Gammu to
consume quite a lot of CPU power.

.B PhoneID
String with info about phone used for sending/receiving. This can be useful if
you want to run several SMS daemons.

When you set PhoneID, all messages (including injected ones) will be marked
by this string (stored as SenderID in the database) and it allows more SMS
daemons to share a single database.

.B RunOnReceive
Executes a program after receiving message.
.sp
This parameter is executed through shell, so you might need to escape some
special characters and you can include any number of parameters. Additionally
parameters with identifiers of received messages are appended to the command
line. The identifiers depend on used service backend, typically it is ID of
inserted row for database backends or file name for file based backends.
.sp
Gammu SMSD waits for the script to terminate. If you make some time consuming
there, it will make SMSD not receive new messages. However to limit breakage
from this situation, the waiting time is limited to two minutes. After this
time SMSD will continue in normal operation and might execute your script
again.
.sp
The process has available lot of information about received message in
environment, check \fIgammu\-smsd\-run\fP for more details.

This can be used to proactively react on some failures or to interactively
detect failure of sending message.
.sp
The program will receive optional parameter, which can currently be either
\fBINIT\fP (meaning failure during phone initialization) or message ID,
which would indicate error while sending the message.

The environment with message (as is in \fI\%RunOnReceive\fP) is not passed to the command.

.SH MESSAGE FILTERING
.sp
SMSD allows one to process only limited subset of incoming messages. You can define
filters for sender number in \fI\%[include_numbers]\fP and
\fI\%[exclude_numbers]\fP sections or using
\fI\%IncludeNumbersFile\fP and \fI\%ExcludeNumbersFile\fP
directives.
.sp
If \fI\%[include_numbers]\fP section exists, all values (keys are
ignored) from it are used as allowed phone numbers and no other message is
processed. On the other side, in \fI\%[exclude_numbers]\fP you can
specify numbers which you want to skip.
.sp
Lists from both sources are merged together. If there is any number in include
list, only include list is used and only messages in this list are being
accepted. If include list is empty, exclude list can be used to ignore
messages from some numbers. If both lists are empty, all messages are
accepted.
.sp
Similar filtering rules can be used for SMSC number filtering, they just use
different set of configuration options \- \fI\%[include_smsc]\fP and
\fI\%[exclude_smsc]\fP sections or \fI\%IncludeSMSCFile\fP
and \fI\%ExcludeSMSCFile\fP directives.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
There is more complete example available in Gammu documentation. Please note
that for simplicity following examples do not include \fB[gammu]\fP
section, you can look into \fIgammurc\fP for some examples how it can look like.
.SS Files service
.sp
SMSD configuration file for FILES backend could look like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[smsd]
Service = files

InboxPath = /var/spool/sms/inbox/
OutboPpath = /var/spool/sms/outbox/
SentSMSPath = /var/spool/sms/sent/
ErrorSMSPath = /var/spool/sms/error/

Host = smsd
.ft P
