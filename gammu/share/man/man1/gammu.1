.SS SMS and EMS commands
.sp
Sending messages might look a bit complicated on first attempt to use.
But be patient, the command line has been written in order to allow
almost every usage. See EXAMPLE section for some hints on usage.
.sp
There is also an option to use \fIgammu\-smsd\fP when you want to send or
receive more messages and process them automatically.
.SS Introduction to SMS formats
.sp
Gammu has support for many SMS formats like:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Nokia Smart Messaging
used for monochromatic picture images, downloadable profiles, monochromatic operator logos, monochromatic caller logos and monophonic ringtones
.TP
.B Linked SMS
both with 8 and 16\-bit identification numbers in headers
.TP
.B EMS
this is SMS format used for saving monochromatic images, monophonic ringtones, animations, text formatting and others
.TP
.B MMS notifications
contains links where phone should download MMS
.TP
.B Alcatel logo messages
proprietary format for logos
.UNINDENT
.sp
You need to ensure that the target phone supports message type you want to
send. Otherwise the phone will not be able to display it or will even crash,
because firmware of phone did not expect this possibility.
.SS Encoding chars in SMS text
.sp
Text in SMS can be coded using two ways:
.SS GSM Default Alphabet
.sp
With \fIGSM Default Alphabet\fP you can fit at most 160 chars into single SMS
(Gammu doesn\(aqt support compressing such texts according to GSM standards, but
it isn\(aqt big limit, because there are no phones supporting them), but they\(aqre
from limited set:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
all Latin small and large
.IP \(bu 2
all digits
.IP \(bu 2
some Greek
.IP \(bu 2
some other national
.IP \(bu 2
some symbols like  @\ ! " # & / ( )\ % * + = \- , .\ :\ ; < >\ ?
.IP \(bu 2
few others
.UNINDENT
.SS Unicode
.sp
With \fIUnicode\fP single SMS can contain at most 70 chars, but these can be
any chars including all national and special ones.
.IP Warning
Please note, that some older phones might have problems displaying such
message.
.RE
.SS Conversion
.sp
Gammu tries to do the best to handle non ASCII characters in your message.
Everything is internally handled in Unicode (the input is converted depending
on your locales configuration) and in case message uses Unicode the text will
be given as such to the message.
.sp
Should the message be sent in GSM Default Alphabet, Gammu will try to convert
all characters to keep message readable. Gammu does support multi byte
encoding for some characters in GSM Default Alphabet (it is needed for \fB^\fP \fB{\fP \fB}\fP
\fB\e\fP \fB[\fP \fB]\fP \fB~\fP \fB|\fP). The characters which are not present in GSM Default Alphabet
are transliterated to closest ASCII equivalent (accents are removed).
Remaining not known characters are replaced by question mark.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B deleteallsms folder
Delete all SMS from specified SMS folder.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B deletesms folder start [stop]
Delete SMS from phone. See description for \fI\%gammu getsms\fP for info about
sms folders naming convention.
.sp
Locations are numerated from 1.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B displaysms ... (options like in sendsms)
Displays PDU data of encoded SMS messages. It accepts same parameters and
behaves same like sendsms.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B getallsms \-pbk
Get all SMS from phone. In some phones you will have also SMS templates
and info about locations used to save Picture Images. With each sms you
will see location. If you want to get such sms from phone alone, use
\fI\%gammu getsms\fP.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B geteachsms \-pbk
Similiary to \fI\%gammu getallsms\fP. Difference is, that
links all concatenated sms
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B getsms folder start [stop]
Get SMS.
.sp
Locations are numerated from 1.
.sp
Folder 0 means that sms is being read from "flat" memory (all sms from all
folders have unique numbers). It\(aqs sometimes emulated by Gammu. You
can use it with all phones.
.sp
Other folders like 1, 2, etc. match folders in phone such as Inbox, Outbox, etc.
and each sms has unique number in his folder. Name of folders can
depend on your phone (the most often 1="Inbox", 2="Outbox", etc.).
This method is not supported by all phones (for example, not supported
by Nokia 3310, 5110, 6110). If work with your phone, use
\fI\%gammu getsmsfolders\fP to get folders list.
