.. _gammu-smsdrc:

SMSD Configuration File
=======================

Description
-----------

gammu-smsd reads configuration from a config file. It's location can be
specified on command line, otherwise default path ``/etc/gammu-smsdrc``
is used.

This file use ini file syntax, see :ref:`ini`.

Configuration file of gammu-smsd consists of at least two sections -
:config:section:`[gammu]` and :config:section:`[smsd]`. For :ref:`gammu-smsd-sql`
you can also use :config:section:`[sql]`.

The :config:section:`[gammu]` section is configuration of a phone connection
and is same as described in :ref:`gammurc` with the only exception that
:config:option:`LogFile` is ignored and common logging for gammu library and
SMS daemon is used. However the :config:option:`LogFormat` directive still
configures how much messages gammu emits.

.. config:section:: [smsd]

    The :config:section:`[smsd]` section configures SMS daemon itself, which are described in
    following subsections. First general parameters of SMS daemon are listed and
    then specific parameters for storage backends.

.. config:section:: [include_numbers]

    List of numbers from which accept messages, see :ref:`message_filtering`.

.. config:section:: [exclude_numbers]

    List of numbers from which reject messages, see :ref:`message_filtering`.

.. config:section:: [include_smsc]

    List of SMSC numbers from which accept messages, see :ref:`message_filtering`.

.. config:section:: [exclude_smsc]

    List of SMSC numbers from which reject messages, see :ref:`message_filtering`.

.. config:section:: [sql]

    Configure SQL queries used by :ref:`gammu-smsd-sql`, you usually don't have to modify them.

    .. seealso:: :ref:`Configurable queries`

General parameters of SMS daemon
--------------------------------

.. config:option:: Service

    SMSD service to use, one of following choices:

    ``FILES``
        stores messages in files, see :ref:`gammu-smsd-files` for details
    ``NULL``
        does not store messages at all, see :ref:`gammu-smsd-null` for details
    ``SQL``
        stores messages in SQL database, see :ref:`gammu-smsd-sql` for details

        .. versionadded:: 1.28.93
    ``MYSQL``
        synonym for :config:option:`Service` = ``SQL`` and :config:option:`Driver` = ``native_mysql``

        stores messages in MySQL database, see :ref:`gammu-smsd-mysql` for details

        .. deprecated:: 1.28.93
    ``PGSQL``
        synonym for :config:option:`Service` = ``SQL`` and :config:option:`Driver` = ``native_pgsql``

        stores messages in PostgreSQL database, see :ref:`gammu-smsd-pgsql` for details

        .. deprecated:: 1.28.93
    ``DBI``
        synonym for :config:option:`Service` = ``SQL`` and :config:option:`Driver` = DBI driver

        stores messages in any database supported by libdbi, this includes
        MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite databases, see :ref:`gammu-smsd-dbi` for
        details

        .. deprecated:: 1.28.93

    .. note::

        Availability of backends depends on platform and compile time configuration.

.. config:option:: PIN

    PIN for SIM card. This is optional, but you should set it if your phone after
    power on requires PIN.

.. config:option:: NetworkCode

    Network personalisation password. This is optional, but some phones require it
    after power on.

.. config:option:: PhoneCode

    Phone lock password. This is optional, but some phones require it after power
    on.

.. config:option:: LogFile

    File where SMSD actions are being logged. You can also use special value
    ``syslog`` which will send all messages to syslog daemon. On Windows another
    special value ``eventlog`` exists, which will send logs to Windows Event Log.

    If you run SMSD as a system daemon (or service), it is recommended to use
    absolute path to log file as startup directory might be different than you
    expect.

    Default is to provide no logging.

.. config:option:: LogFacility

    Facility to use on logging backends which support it (currently only
    syslog). One of following chouces:

    * ``DAEMON`` (default)
    * ``USER``
    * ``LOCAL0``
    * ``LOCAL1``
    * ``LOCAL2``
    * ``LOCAL3``
    * ``LOCAL4``
    * ``LOCAL5``
    * ``LOCAL6``
    * ``LOCAL7``

    .. versionadded:: 1.30.91

.. config:option:: DebugLevel

    Debug level for SMSD. The integer value should be sum of all flags you
    want to enable.

    1
        enables basic debugging information
    2
        enables logging of SQL queries of service backends
    4
        enables logging of gammu debug information

    Generally to get as much debug information as possible, use 255.

    Default is 0, what should mean no extra information.

.. config:option:: CommTimeout

    How many seconds should SMSD wait after there is no message in outbox.

    Default is 30.

.. config:option:: SendTimeout

    Shows how many seconds SMSD should wait for network answer during sending
    sms. If nothing happen during this time, sms will be resent.

    Default is 30.

.. config:option:: MaxRetries

    How many times will SMSD try to resend message if sending fails.

    Default is 1.

.. config:option:: ReceiveFrequency

    The number of seconds between testing for received SMSes, when the phone is
    busy sending SMSes. Normally a test for received SMSes is done every
    :config:option:`CommTimeout` seconds and after each sent SMS.

    Default is 0 (not used).

.. config:option:: StatusFrequency

    The number of seconds between refreshing phone status (battery, signal) stored
    in shared memory and possibly in service backends. Use 0 to disable.

    Default is 15.

.. config:option:: LoopSleep

    The number of seconds how long will SMSD sleep before checking for some
    activity. Please note that setting this to higher value than 1 will have
    effects to other time based configurations, because they will be effectively
    rounded to multiply of this value.

    Setting this to 0 disables sleeping. Please not this might cause Gammu to
    consume quite a lot of CPU power.

    Default is 1.

.. config:option:: MultipartTimeout

    The number of seconds how long will SMSD wait for all parts of multipart
    message. If all parts won't arrive in time, parts will be processed as separate
    messages.

    Default is 600 (10 minutes).

.. config:option:: CheckSecurity

    Whether to check if phone wants to enter PIN.

    Default is 1 (enabled).

.. config:option:: CheckBattery

    Whether to check phone battery state periodically.

    Default is 1 (enabled).

.. config:option:: CheckSignal

    Whether to check signal level periodically.

    Default is 1 (enabled).

.. config:option:: ResetFrequency

    The number of seconds between performing a preventive soft reset in order to
    minimize the cases of hanging phones e.g. Nokia 5110 will sometimes freeze to
    a state when only after unmounting the battery the phone will be functional
    again.

    Default is 0 (not used).

.. config:option:: HardResetFrequency

    .. versionadded:: 1.28.92

    .. warning::

       For some phones hard reset means deleting all data in it. Use
       :config:option:`ResetFrequency`, unless you know what you are doing.

    The number of seconds between performing a preventive hard reset in order to
    minimize the cases of hanging phones.

    Default is 0 (not used).

.. config:option:: DeliveryReport

    Whether delivery reports should be used, one of ``no``, ``log``, ``sms``.

    ``log``
        one line log entry,
    ``sms``
        store in inbox as a received SMS
    ``no``
        no delivery reports

    Default is ``no``.

.. config:option:: DeliveryReportDelay

    Delay in seconds how long is still delivery report considered valid. This
    depends on brokeness of your network (delivery report should have same
    timestamp as sent message). Increase this if delivery reports are not paired
    with sent messages.

    Default is 600 (10 minutes).

.. config:option:: PhoneID

    String with info about phone used for sending/receiving. This can be useful if
    you want to run several SMS daemons.

    When you set PhoneID, all messages (including injected ones) will be marked
    by this string (stored as SenderID in the database) and it allows more SMS
    daemons to share a single database. 
    
    This option has actually no effect with :ref:`gammu-smsd-files`.

.. config:option:: RunOnReceive

    Executes a program after receiving message.

    This parameter is executed through shell, so you might need to escape some
    special characters and you can include any number of parameters. Additionally
    parameters with identifiers of received messages are appended to the command
    line. The identifiers depend on used service backend, typically it is ID of
    inserted row for database backends or file name for file based backends.

    Gammu SMSD waits for the script to terminate. If you make some time consuming
    there, it will make SMSD not receive new messages. However to limit breakage
    from this situation, the waiting time is limited to two minutes. After this
    time SMSD will continue in normal operation and might execute your script
    again.

    The process has available lot of information about received message in
    environment, check :ref:`gammu-smsd-run` for more details.

.. config:option:: RunOnFailure

    .. versionadded:: 1.28.93

    Executes a program on failure.

    This can be used to proactively react on some failures or to interactively
    detect failure of sending message.

    The program will receive optional parameter, which can currently be either
    ``INIT`` (meaning failure during phone initialization) or message ID,
    which would indicate error while sending the message.

    .. note:: The environment with message (as is in :config:option:`RunOnReceive`) is not passed to the command.

.. config:option:: IncludeNumbersFile

    File with list of numbers which are accepted by SMSD. The file contains one
    number per line, blank lines are ignored. The file is read at startup and is
    reread only when configuration is being reread. See Message filtering for
    details.

.. config:option:: ExcludeNumbersFile

    File with list of numbers which are not accepted by SMSD. The file contains
    one number per line, blank lines are ignored. The file is read at startup and
    is reread only when configuration is being reread. See Message filtering for
    details.

.. config:option:: IncludeSMSCFile

    File with list of SMSC numbers which are accepted by SMSD. The file contains
    one number per line, blank lines are ignored. The file is read at startup and
    is reread only when configuration is being reread. See Message filtering for
    details.

.. config:option:: ExcludeSMSCFile

    File with list of SMSC numbers which are not accepted by SMSD. The file
    contains one number per line, blank lines are ignored. The file is read at
    startup and is reread only when configuration is being reread. See Message
    filtering for details.

.. config:option:: BackendRetries

    How many times will SMSD backend retry operation.

    The implementation on different backends is different, for database backends
    it generally means how many times it will try to reconnect to the server.

    Default is 10.

.. config:option:: Send

    .. versionadded:: 1.28.91

    Whether to enable sending of messages.

    Default is True.

.. config:option:: Receive

    .. versionadded:: 1.28.91

    Whether to enable receiving of messages.

    Default is True.


Database backends options
-------------------------

All DBI, ODBC, MYSQL and PGSQL backends (see :ref:`gammu-smsd-mysql`,
:ref:`gammu-smsd-odbc`, :ref:`gammu-smsd-pgsql`, :ref:`gammu-smsd-dbi` for
their documentation) supports same options for configuring connection to a
database:

.. config:option:: User

    User name used for connection to a database.

.. config:option:: Password

    Password used for connection to a database.

.. config:option:: Host

    Database server address. It can also contain port or socket path after
    semicolon, for example ``localhost:/path/to/socket`` or
    ``192.168.1.1:8000``.

    For ODBC this is used as Data source name.

    .. note::
        
        Some database servers differentiate usage of ``localhost`` (to use
        local socket) and ``127.0.0.1`` (to use locat TCP/IP connection).
        Please make sure your SMSD settings match the database server ones.

    .. versionadded:: 1.28.92

.. config:option:: PC

    Synonym for :config:option:`Host`.

    .. deprecated:: 1.28.92

.. config:option:: Database

    Name of database to use. Please note that you should create tables in this
    database before using gammu-smsd. SQL files for creating needed tables are
    included in documentation.

.. config:option:: SkipSMSCNumber

    When you send sms from some SMS centere you can have delivery reports from
    other SMSC number. You can set here number of this SMSC used by you and Gammu
    will not check it's number during assigning reports to sent SMS.

.. config:option:: Driver

    SQL driver to use.

    Can be either one of native drivers (``odbc``, ``native_mysql`` or
    ``native_pgsql``) or :ref:`gammu-smsd-dbi` driver.

    Depends on what DBI drivers you have installed, DBI
    supports: ``mysql``, ``freetds`` (provides access to MS SQL Server and
    Sybase), ``pgsql``, ``sqlite``, ``sqlite3``, ``firebird`` and ``ingres``,
    ``msql`` and ``oracle`` drivers are under development.

.. config:option:: SQL

    SQL dialect to use. This is specially useful with :ref:`gammu-smsd-odbc` where SMSD
    does not know which server it is actually talking to.

    Possible values:

    * ``mysql`` - MySQL
    * ``pgsql`` - PostgreSQL
    * ``sqlite`` - SQLite
    * ``mssql`` - Microsoft SQL Server
    * ``sybase`` - Sybase
    * ``access`` - Microsoft Access
    * ``odbc`` - Generic ODBC

    .. versionadded:: 1.28.93

    .. seealso:: You can also completely customize SQL queries used as described in :ref:`SQL Queries`.

.. config:option:: DriversPath

    Path, where DBI drivers are stored, this usually does not have to be set if
    you have properly installed drivers.

.. config:option:: DBDir

    Database directory for some (currently only sqlite) DBI drivers. Set here path
    where sqlite database files are stored.

Files backend options
+++++++++++++++++++++

The FILES backend accepts following configuration options. See
:ref:`gammu-smsd-files` for more detailed service backend description. Please note
that all path should contain trailing path separator (/ on Unix systems):

.. config:option:: InboxPath

    Where the received SMSes are stored.

    Default is current directory.

.. config:option:: OutboxPath

    Where SMSes to be sent should be placed.

    Default is current directory.

.. config:option:: SentSMSPath

    Where the transmitted SMSes are placed, if same as :config:option:`OutboxPath` transmitted
    messages are deleted.

    Default is to delete transmitted messages.

.. config:option:: ErrorSMSPath

    Where SMSes with error in transmission is placed.

    Default is same as :config:option:`SentSMSPath`.

.. config:option:: InboxFormat

    The format in which the SMS will be stored: ``detail``, ``unicode``, ``standard``.

    ``detail``
        format used for message backup by :ref:`gammu`, see :ref:`gammu-smsbackup`.
    ``unicode``
        message text stored in unicode (UTF-16)
    ``standard``
        message text stored in system charset

    The ``standard`` and ``unicode`` settings do not apply for 8-bit messages, which
    are always written raw as they are received with extension .bin.

    Default is ``unicode``.

    .. note::

        In ``detail`` format, all message parts are stored into signle file,
        for all others each message part is saved separately.

.. config:option:: OutboxFormat

    The format in which messages created by :ref:`gammu-smsd-inject` will be stored,
    it accepts same values as InboxFormat.

    Default is ``detail`` if Gammu is compiled in with backup functions, ``unicode``
    otherwise.

.. config:option:: TransmitFormat

    The format for transmitting the SMS: ``auto``, ``unicode``, ``7bit``.

    Default is ``auto``.

.. _message_filtering:

Message filtering
-----------------

SMSD allows one to process only limited subset of incoming messages. You can define
filters for sender number in :config:section:`[include_numbers]` and
:config:section:`[exclude_numbers]` sections or using
:config:option:`IncludeNumbersFile` and :config:option:`ExcludeNumbersFile`
directives.

If :config:section:`[include_numbers]` section exists, all values (keys are
ignored) from it are used as allowed phone numbers and no other message is
processed. On the other side, in :config:section:`[exclude_numbers]` you can
specify numbers which you want to skip.

Lists from both sources are merged together. If there is any number in include
list, only include list is used and only messages in this list are being
accepted. If include list is empty, exclude list can be used to ignore
messages from some numbers. If both lists are empty, all messages are
accepted.

Similar filtering rules can be used for SMSC number filtering, they just use
different set of configuration options - :config:section:`[include_smsc]` and
:config:section:`[exclude_smsc]` sections or :config:option:`IncludeSMSCFile`
and :config:option:`ExcludeSMSCFile` directives.

Examples
--------

There is more complete example available in Gammu documentation. Please note
that for simplicity following examples do not include :config:section:`[gammu]`
section, you can look into :ref:`gammurc` for some examples how it can look like.

Files service
+++++++++++++

SMSD configuration file for FILES backend could look like:

.. code-block:: ini

    [smsd]
    Service = files
    PIN = 1234
    LogFile = syslog
    InboxPath = /var/spool/sms/inbox/
    OutboPpath = /var/spool/sms/outbox/
    SentSMSPath = /var/spool/sms/sent/
    ErrorSMSPath = /var/spool/sms/error/

MySQL service
+++++++++++++

If you want to use MYSQL backend, you will need something like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [smsd]
    Service = sql
    Driver = native_mysql
    PIN = 1234
    LogFile = syslog
    User = smsd
    Password = smsd
    PC = localhost
    Database = smsd

DBI service using SQLite
++++++++++++++++++++++++

For :ref:`gammu-smsd-dbi` backend, in this particular case SQLite:

.. code-block:: ini

    [smsd]
    Service = sql
    Driver = sqlite3
    DBDir = /var/lib/sqlite3
    Database = smsd.db

ODBC service using MySQL
++++++++++++++++++++++++

For :ref:`gammu-smsd-odbc` backend, in this particular case using DSN ``smsd`` server:

.. code-block:: ini

    [smsd]
    Service = sql
    Driver = odbc
    Host = smsd

The DSN definition (in :file:`~/.odbc.ini` on UNIX) for using MySQL server would look like:

.. code-block:: ini

    [smsd]
    Description		= MySQL
    Driver		= MySQL
    Server		= 127.0.0.1
    Database		= smsd
    Port		= 
    Socket		= 
    Option		= 
    Stmt		= 

    [smsdsuse]
    Driver		= MySQL ODBC 3.51.27r695 Driver
    DATABASE		= smsd
    SERVER		= 127.0.0.1


Numbers filtering
+++++++++++++++++

Process only messages from 123456 number:

.. code-block:: ini

    [include_numbers]
    number1 = 123456

Do not process messages from evil number 666:

.. code-block:: ini

    [exclude_numbers]
    number1 = 666

Debugging
+++++++++

Enabling debugging:

.. code-block:: ini

    [smsd]
    debuglevel = 255
    logfile = smsd.log
