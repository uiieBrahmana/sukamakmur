DBI Backend
===========

Description
-----------

DBI backend stores all data in any database supported by `libdbi`_, which
parameters are defined by configuration (see :ref:`gammu-smsdrc` for description of
configuration options).

For tables description see :ref:`gammu-smsd-tables`.

This backend is based on :ref:`gammu-smsd-sql`.

.. note::

    The DBI driver is currently not supported on Windows because libdbi
    library does not support this platform.


Configuration
-------------

Before running :ref:`gammu-smsd` you need to create necessary tables in the
database. You can use examples given in database specific backends parts of
this manual to do that.

The configuration file then can look like:

.. code-block:: ini

    [smsd]
    service = sql
    driver = DBI_DRIVER
    host = localhost

.. seealso:: :ref:`gammu-smsdrc`

    also scripts for other databases in same folder.
