SMSD Database Structure
=======================

The backends themselves are described in their sections, this document
describes general database structure and required tables.

More SMS daemons can share single database. If you do not specify PhoneID in
their configuration, all are treated equally and you have no guarantee which
one sends outgoing message. If you configure PhoneID and use it when inserting
message to the ``outbox`` table (:ref:`gammu-smsd-inject` does this), each SMS
daemon will have separate outbox queue.

Receiving of messages
---------------------

Received messages are stored in :ref:`inbox` table.

Transmitting of messages
------------------------

Transmitted messages are read from table :ref:`outbox` and possible subsequent parts
of the same message from :ref:`outbox_multipart`.

Examples
--------

Creating tables
+++++++++++++++

SQL scripts to create all needed tables for most databases are included in
Gammu documentation (docs/sql). As well as some PHP scripts interacting with
the database.

For example to create SQLite tables, issue following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    sqlite3 smsd.db < docs/sql/sqlite.sql

Injecting a message using SQL
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To send a message, you can either use :ref:`gammu-smsd-inject`, which does all the
magic for you, or you can insert the message manually. The simplest example is
short text message:

.. code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO outbox (
        DestinationNumber,
        TextDecoded,
        CreatorID,
        Coding
    ) VALUES (
        '800123465',
        'This is a SQL test message',
        'Program',
        'Default_No_Compression'
    );

Please note usage of ``TextDecoded`` field, for ``Text`` field, you would have
to hex encode the unicode text:

.. code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO outbox (
        DestinationNumber,
        Text,
        CreatorID,
        Coding
    ) VALUES (
        '800123465',
        '005400680069007300200069007300200061002000530051004c002000740065007300740020006d006500730073006100670065',
        'Program',
        'Default_No_Compression'
    );

Injecting long message using SQL
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Inserting multipart messages is a bit more tricky, you need to construct also
UDH header and store it hexadecimally written into UDH field. Unless you have
a good reason to do this manually, use :ref:`gammu-smsd-inject`.

For long text message, the UDH starts with ``050003`` followed by byte as a
message reference (you can put anything there, but it should be different for
each message, ``D3`` in following example), byte for number of messages (``02``
in example, it should be unique for each message you send to same phone number)
and byte for number of current message (``01`` for first message, ``02`` for
second, etc.).

For example long text message of two parts could look like following:

.. code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO outbox (
        CreatorID,
        MultiPart,
        DestinationNumber,
        UDH,
        TextDecoded,
        Coding
    ) VALUES (
        'Gammu 1.23.91',
        'true',
        '123465',
        '050003D30201',
        'Mqukqirip ya konej eqniu rejropocejor hugiygydewl tfej nrupxujob xuemymiyliralj. Te tvyjuh qaxumur ibewfoiws zuucoz tdygu gelum L ejqigqesykl kya jdytbez',
        'Default_No_Compression'
    )

    INSERT INTO outbox_multipart (
        SequencePosition,
        UDH,
        Class,
        TextDecoded,
        ID,
        Coding
    ) VALUES (
        2,
        '050003D30202',
        'u xewz qisubevumxyzk ufuylehyzc. Nse xobq dfolizygqysj t bvowsyhyhyemim ovutpapeaempye giuuwbib.',
        <ID_OF_INSERTED_RECORD_IN_OUBOX_TABLE>,
        'Default_No_Compression'
    )

.. note::

    Adding UDH means that you have less space for text, in above example you
    can use only 153 characters in single message.
