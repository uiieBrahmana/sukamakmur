After playing a while with my 5120i y find some use full frames:

got from sneefing in Logomanger the get startup logo
----------------------------------------------------

request::

    40 {0x07, 0x07, 0x08, section} section goes from 1 to 6

answer::

    dd {+0x01, 0x00, 0x07, 0x08, (84 bytes => 84 cols x 8 bits bit0 first row )

Cant figure out how to modify 6110 code to get & put the logo, not in a
hi value to me now.

got key press working
---------------------

As stated in http://www.flosys.com/tdma/n5160.html

with frame: key-press::

    D1 {+00 01 50 00 01 KY}

this seems to press the key for a while. No release needed

key-release:

    D1 {+00 01 50 00 00 KY}

keep the key press => got speedee dial::

    D1 {+00 01 50 00 02 00 KY}

get memory
----------

the getmemory::
    40 {+00 00 07 11 00 10 00 mem}

get phonebook with the phone in bcd, but it seems to be a way to read
chunks of memory with diferent numbers in the 6 place. in particular:

get configuration pins::

    40 {+0x00, 0x00, 0x07, 0x11, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x00, 0x00 }

get security code::

    40 {+0x00, 0x00, 0x07, 0x11, 0x00, 0x09, 0x00, 0x00 }

get NAM data ::

    40 {+0x00, 0x00, 0x07, 0x11, 0x00, 0x08, 0x00, nam# }

that last answers with::

    dd {+01 00 11 00 08 00 00,

More interesting ( and dangerous ) is than the 07 10 sequence  in place
of 07 11 in the request change the command from read to write.be care
full!!! I almost ruin my 5125 with a 40 {+0x00, 0x00, 0x07, 0x10, 0x00,
0x08, 0x00, 0x01 } frame , since the frame is ok, but the phone the
write info from an area of the buffer that I did not send!!!!

OK so far. Still looking for how to handle SMS......
