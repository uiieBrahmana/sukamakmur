hello Marcin

I've made a script so that any user can send sms's to ther gammu configured 
server's mobile phone, and receive a server processed information based on 
the sent sms.

i.e.: my personal phone is a nokia 6210. I have a 6110 connected with gammu
in my linux box.

whenever I need to know the internet ip of my server, I send from my 6210 to 
the 6110 a sms with the text: " admin ip", and in a few seconds I receive 
the message back to my 6210 from my 6110: " Your ip is .... ".

if I send "admin uptime" it answers the current server's uptime, etc...

feel free to include this script in future free releases of gammu.

Gammu is very useful for me, so I hope this script can be that much useful 
to you

thats my little contribute to the gammu project

Best regards

Hugo Pinto
